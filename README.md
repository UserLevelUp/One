This uility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.
See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.   Notice each field to be entered by
a user is sepated by a colon i.e. `:`.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
